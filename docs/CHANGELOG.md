# Formango

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Implemented Register function on the Field object and the FieldArray object, meaning you create subforms more easily. <br/>Visit the [documentation](https://wisemen-digital.github.io/vue-formango/examples/subforms) for an example.
- Changed the useForm API to use a single object. <br/>For future updates / features the API doesn't need breaking changes this way.
- Added tests.
- Refactored library based on tests.
- Updated docs for 2.0 and added more examples.
